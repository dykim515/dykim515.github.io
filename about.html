				<h4>Dayoung Kim</h4>
				<p>I'm a graduate student in linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. My research interests lie primarily in Experimental Syntax which explores the syntax of natural language using experimental methods. I'm also interested in how people process language and the interaction between processing of natural language and its grammar. </p>
