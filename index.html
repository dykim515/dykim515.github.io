								<h2>Complexity effects in Dependencies</h2>
								<p>The current study aims at investigating the syntactic representation of gap in A-dependencies compared to A-bar dependencies
								using complexity effects (e.g., D-linking). Experimental methods such as acceptability judgment task are used to test the varying degrees of the effect of complexity on processing different types of dependencies.</p>

								<h2>Korean Language Teaching</h2>
								<p>"Taking LIHL 115W with Dayoung Kim was one of the greatest experiences at UCSD. I was
always excited to get to class and learn more about the Korean culture and language. I would strongly recommend her to other students." "Very exuberant and has complete control of the classroom." She's the best you can ask for in
a teacher for a language class." -student comments
